# AzureML

A demonstration of basic scripts for Azure ML machine learning model building.
I run those models in preparation for my Azure Data Science Associate certification exam.

Contains three notebooks:
- Simple ML experiment with a script
- Hyperparameter tunning with Azure ML
- AutoML feature with python sdk

Basic steps include:
- Creating a compute
- Loading and registering a dataset
- Creating an environment
- Creating an experiment and a config
- Evaluating results
